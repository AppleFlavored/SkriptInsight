# SkriptInsight
SkriptInsight is a language server for [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript).
This project is a continuation/remake of the [original](https://github.com/SkriptInsight/SkriptInsight)
SkriptInsight project, which (as of June 14, 2022) is archived.

## Why?
Currently, Skript does not have proper tools for development. At most, extensions provide
basic syntax highlighting.

SkriptInsight is an attempt to provide a better, smart experience for Skript developers.
